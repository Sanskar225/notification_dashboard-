## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v14 or higher
- npm v6 or higher

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sanskar225/notification_dashboard-
cd notification_dashboard-
```

### 2. Start the Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env      # copy environment config (edit if needed)
npm run dev               # development mode with auto-reload
# or
npm start                 # production mode
```

The backend server starts at **http://localhost:3000**

> **Default config** — the server works out of the box with no `.env` changes. Auto-notifications fire every 10 seconds and WebSocket connections are accepted from any origin.

### 3. Start the Frontend (Development Mode)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend dev server starts at **http://localhost:5173** and automatically proxies `/api`, `/health`, and `/socket.io` requests to the backend.

### 4. Build Frontend for Production (Optional)

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

This outputs built files to `../client/`, which the backend serves via `express.static`. After building, the entire app is available at **http://localhost:3000** — no separate frontend server needed.

## 🔌 Method Choice: WebSockets vs SSE

**This project uses WebSockets via Socket.IO.**

| Feature | WebSockets (chosen) | Server-Sent Events |
|---|---|---|
| Communication | Bidirectional | Server → Client only |
| Protocol | `ws://` / `wss://` | HTTP |
| Reconnection | Built-in (Socket.IO) | Manual implementation |
| Room/Group support | Native | Not supported |
| Fallback transport | HTTP long-polling | None |
| Binary support | Yes | Text only |

**Why WebSockets?**

The core reason is **bidirectionality**. In this system, clients don't just receive notifications — they also send them. A user can broadcast a message to all clients, target a specific user by ID, send to a room, or schedule a delayed notification. All of this requires data flowing from client to server, which SSE cannot do.

Additionally, Socket.IO's room-based pub/sub makes group notifications trivial — `io.to(roomId).emit(...)` delivers a message only to members of that room. Replicating this with SSE would require maintaining per-room subscription lists manually and polling or long-polling to receive client input, which negates SSE's simplicity advantage.

Socket.IO also adds automatic reconnection with exponential backoff, heartbeat/ping-pong to detect stale connections, and transparent fallback to HTTP long-polling when WebSocket is blocked by a corporate proxy — all of which matter in a production system.

## 📡 How Real-Time Communication Works

### Connection Lifecycle

When a client loads the page:

```
1. Socket.IO performs WebSocket handshake (upgrades from HTTP)
2. Server generates a unique USER_id (e.g. USER_1703001234567_ab3f9c2d)
3. Client is automatically added to the "general" room
4. Server emits `welcome` → client stores its userId and active count
5. Server broadcasts `clients-update` → all clients refresh their user list
```

### Notification Delivery Methods

```
Auto (every 10s):   Server ──► io.emit('notification')            ──► ALL clients
Broadcast:          Client ──► 'send-broadcast'  ──► Server ──► ALL clients
Targeted:           Client ──► 'send-targeted'   ──► Server ──► ONE client (by userId)
Group:              Client ──► 'send-to-group'   ──► Server ──► ROOM members only
Scheduled:          Client ──► 'schedule-notification' ──► Server setTimeout ──► broadcast
Event trigger:      Client ──► 'trigger-event'   ──► Server ──► ALL clients
```

### Connection Tracking

The server maintains two Maps in `ConnectionManager`:

```js
this.clients  = new Map()   // socketId  → full client object
this.userIdMap = new Map()  // userId    → socketId
```

On every connect/disconnect, the server broadcasts `clients-update` with the current count and client list. The frontend `useSocket` hook listens to this event and updates `activeClients` state in real time — no polling required.

Stats tracked:
- Current active connections
- Peak connections (historical high)
- Total connections since server start
- Per-client: connected timestamp, last ping, IP, joined rooms

### Disconnect & Reconnection Handling

```
Client disconnects
  └─► 'disconnect' event fires on server
  └─► ConnectionManager removes client from Map
  └─► RoomManager removes client from all rooms it joined
  └─► io.emit('clients-update') fires → all clients update their count
  └─► If a non-default room becomes empty → room is deleted automatically

Client reconnects (Socket.IO handles this automatically)
  └─► New socket created, new USER_id assigned
  └─► Client re-joins 'general' room
  └─► `welcome` event re-emitted with new userId
  └─► Frontend shows "Reconnected" toast
```

Idle connections (no ping for 5+ minutes) are cleaned up by a background task in `ConnectionManager.cleanupIdleConnections()`.

### Auto-Notification Scheduler

Every 10 seconds (configurable via `AUTO_NOTIFICATION_INTERVAL`):

```js
setInterval(() => {
  if (activeClients > 0) {
    const notification = generateRandomNotification() // weighted random from pool
    io.emit('notification', notification)             // broadcast to all
  }
}, interval)
```

The message pool uses weighted random selection — success messages appear more often than warning messages, matching real-world notification patterns.

## ✨ Features

### Notification Types

| Type | Description | Socket Event |
|---|---|---|
| 📢 Broadcast | Sent to all connected clients | `send-broadcast` |
| 🎯 Targeted | Sent to one specific user by ID | `send-targeted` |
| 👥 Group | Sent to all members of a room | `send-to-group` |
| ⏰ Scheduled | Delivered after a configurable delay | `schedule-notification` |
| ⚡ Event Trigger | Named event broadcast (deploy, alert, etc.) | `trigger-event` |

### Notification Styles

Each notification carries a `type` field that controls its visual styling:

| Style | Color | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| `info` | Blue | General updates |
| `success` | Green | Completions, confirmations |
| `warning` | Yellow | Alerts requiring attention |
| `error` | Red | Failures, critical issues |

### Dashboard

- **Live Stats** — Active users, total notifications sent, server uptime (live counter), active rooms
- **Notification Feed** — Scrollable history of last 100 notifications with type-based filter tabs
- **Connected Users** — Real-time list of all connected clients with connection timestamps
- **Rooms Panel** — Create rooms, join/leave, send group messages, see live member counts
- **Toast Notifications** — Stacked toasts with timer bar and per-type color coding
- **Ticker Bar** — Bottom scrolling ticker showing latest events in real time

### Input Safety

All user-supplied input passes through `utils.js` before reaching the broadcast layer:

- `sanitizeMessage()` — strips `<` and `>` characters (XSS prevention)
- `truncateMessage()` — enforces 200-character hard limit
- `isValidMessage()` — rejects empty or non-string payloads

## 🔧 Potential Improvements

With additional time, the following improvements would move this system toward full production readiness:

**Authentication & Identity**
Integrate JWT tokens so users maintain a persistent identity across reconnections. Currently each reconnect generates a new `USER_id`, which breaks targeted notification history.

**Notification Persistence**
Store notifications in MongoDB or Redis so history survives server restarts. The current in-memory store (last 100 notifications) is lost on restart.

**Read Receipts**
Track which users have received and seen which notifications using a per-notification delivery log, enabling sender confirmation and unread badges.

**Rate Limiting**
Add per-socket throttling (e.g. max 10 messages per 10 seconds) to prevent a single client from flooding the notification stream.

**End-to-End Encryption**
For targeted (private) messages, encrypt the payload before sending and decrypt on the recipient's client — preventing the server from reading private message content.

**Notification Preferences**
Allow users to opt in or out of specific notification types, stored in a user profile. The server would filter delivery based on each recipient's preferences.

**Analytics Dashboard**
Add a separate admin view with time-series charts (using Recharts or D3) showing notification volume, active users over time, and peak connection periods.

**Horizontal Scaling**
Replace the in-memory `ConnectionManager` with a Redis-backed adapter (`socket.io-redis`) so multiple Node.js processes can share connection state — enabling load balancing and zero-downtime deploys.

**Mobile Push Notifications**
Integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to deliver notifications to users who are offline, closing the gap between WebSocket delivery (online only) and true push delivery.

**TypeScript Migration**
Add full type safety across both frontend and backend for better IDE support, refactoring confidence, and self-documenting interfaces.
